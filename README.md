n the "Spree" store's order management interface, HTML is likely used to structure key elements like tables for displaying orders, forms for updating statuses, and buttons for actions such as filtering or viewing order details. This provides an organized layout, making it easy to manage customer orders. One enhancement to improve the HTML structure would be to replace generic <div> elements with more semantic tags like <section> for grouping related content (e.g., an entire order) and <article> for specific details (e.g., customer info or order items). This would improve readability, accessibility, and clarity.

In creating the web system, we combined custom CSS and Bootstrap to design a user-friendly interface. The custom CSS provided a light background with dark text for easy reading, while features like changing input borders on focus and button hover effects added interactivity. We used shadows and borders to give elements depth, and Bootstrap’s grid system allowed the layout to adapt smoothly to different screen sizes. However, one improvement we suggest is to enhance the navigation menu's clarity by adding an active link indicator, such as a different background color or underline for the current page. This change would assist users in navigating the site more easily. Overall, our use of both CSS and Bootstrap contributed to creating a visually appealing and functional web system.In creating the web system, we combined custom CSS and Bootstrap to design a user-friendly interface.

We implemented JavaScript in the web system to manage user interactions, making the application dynamic and responsive. For example, we used event listeners to detect button clicks, triggering functions to submit answers, switch questions, and update scores in real time. This approach allows users to receive immediate feedback on their actions, enhancing engagement. Additionally, we integrated a timer using JavaScript to create a sense of urgency during gameplay. To further improve functionality and user experience, we suggest adding a confirmation dialog before a user submits an answer or passes their turn. This enhancement would help prevent accidental submissions and ensure that users are making intentional choices, leading to a smoother and more enjoyable gaming experience. Overall, JavaScript played a crucial role in making the web system interactive and user-friendly.
