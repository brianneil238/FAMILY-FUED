            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
            <p>Family Feud is a game where two teams compete to guess the most popular answers to survey questions. The goal is to score the highest points by providing correct answers.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Two teams will take turns answering questions.</li>
                <li>Each question will have a set of popular answers based on surveys.</li>
                <li>The team that answers correctly gets points based on the popularity of their answer.</li>
                <li>If a team cannot answer, they can pass the turn to the other team.</li>
                <li>The game continues until all questions have been answered.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Scoring</h2>
            <p>Points are awarded based on the popularity of the answers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 point for each answer revealed on the board.</li>
                <li>The team with the highest points at the end of the game wins!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Special Rules</h2>
            <p>Each team has a limited time to answer, typically 60 seconds. If the time runs out, the question is passed to the other team.</p>
